Shortener - A friendly little bookmarks manager for Google Apps Domain Owners!


##Description:

Shortener is a small nifty app to turn your [Google Apps] [1] service into an awesome simple-to-use bookmark manager!

###Why?
* I'm bored with online bookmarks manager. They suck!
* Problem $1: Who would log into a "service" EACH time one found something cool just to bookmark it.?
* Problem $2: We keep switching workspaces OFTEN! So browser bookmarks don't work either
* Solution: Have a Google Apps Domain? Install this. :)
